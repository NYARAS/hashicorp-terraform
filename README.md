# Hashicorp Terraform Exam Prep Code

### The core Terraform workflow has three steps:

  - Write - Author infrastructure as code.

  - Plan - Preview changes before applying.

  - Apply - Provision reproducible infrastructure.

This guide walks through how each of these three steps plays out in the context of working as an individual practitioner, how they evolve when a team is collaborating on infrastructure, and how Terraform Cloud enables this workflow to run smoothly for entire organizations.
